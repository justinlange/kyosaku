To Run Kyosaku locally:

1. Ignore this first step if you know that your collaberators have not made any changes locally (on their computers)

1a. To refresh: --> via GitHub: Open up your git gui ('graphical user interface') client (GitGui.app) and press 'Commit & Sync'. If this doesn't work, you may have to google the error message and use the command line version.

1. open up chrome with local file cookies enabled. Open Terminal, and run the following command: open -a Google\ Chrome --args --enable-file-cookies

2. When Chrome opens with a new window, navigate to the following address: file:///Users/mariesester/code/kyosaku/index.html#  (replacing mariesester with your username, if on a different computer)

3. To refresh the page to try out new changes, hold down CMD + SHIFT and press R. This is similar to clicking the 'refresh' button in your browser but it clears the cache as well.

4. Finally, to reset the user experience, navigate to: file:///Users/mariesester/code/kyosaku/reset.html
