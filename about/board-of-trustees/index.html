<p><img src="../../images/about/redford.jpg" /></p>
<h4>Robert Redford, President &amp; Founder</h4>
<p>Robert Redford is  somewhat of an anomaly in the entertainment industry. Though he has been  world-famous for some 30 years, he remains a highly private individual. He is  an ardent conservationist and environmentalist, a man who stands for social  responsibility and political involvement and an artist and businessman who is a  staunch supporter of uncompromised creative expression. His passion remains to  make films of substance and social/cultural relevance, as well as to encourage  others to express themselves through the arts.</p>
<p>He is recognized  the world over for the roles he has played and the projects he has directed or  produced throughout a distinguished stage and film career. Believing that it is  the unexpected and uncommon, which ultimately enlivens the cultural ecology of  a society, Redford has nurtured more than a generation of innovative voices in  independent film through his non-profit Sundance Institute and Film Festival.  Harvard Business Review observed, &ldquo;Sundance has become to Hollywood what Silicon  Valley has been to the high-tech industry.&rdquo; His life-long passion for nature  and issues of justice has resulted in Redford being widely acknowledged as a  highly effective and dedicated political and environmental activist.</p>
<h4>Walter L. Weisman, Chairman of the Board</h4>
<p>Walter L. (Wally) Weisman is the chairman of the Board of Trustees  of Sundance Institute.
