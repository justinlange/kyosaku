<h2>January 20-24, 2014 - Sundance Film Festival<br /> Park City, Utah</h2>
<p>The seventh annual Stories of Change Convening took place in January at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. The Convening is an intensive, story workshop that brings together documentary filmmakers and Skoll-supported social entrepreneurs.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Organization Participants</h3>
<h3 class="organization" style="padding-top: 0;"><a href="http://www.basicneeds.org/" target="_blank">BasicNeeds</a></h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Organization Mission</span>: BasicNeeds&rsquo; mission is to enable people with mental illness or epilepsy and their families to live and work successfully in their communities by combining health, socio-economic and community orientated solutions with changes in policy, practice and resource allocation.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Main Organizational Goals</span>:&nbsp; According to the World Health organization,&nbsp; 450 million people in the world suffer from mental illness. In developing countries roughly 90% of these people lack mental health care.&nbsp; BasicNeeds works in a number of developing countries, including India, China, Ghana, Kenya, Laos, Nepal, Pakistan, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Uganda and Vietnam, in order to improve lives of people living with mental illness. The organization prides itself on working with its beneficiaries rather than simply for them.</p>
<p>BasicNeeds uses a model &ndash; termed MHD (Mental Health and Development) &ndash; which aims to address people&rsquo;s mental illnesses as well as their socio-economic challenges. This model breaks&nbsp; down into five independent elements:&nbsp; <strong>Capacity Building</strong>: identifying, mobilizing, sensitizing and training mental health and development stakeholders. <strong>Community Mental Health</strong>: enabling effective and affordable community oriented mental health treatment services. <strong>Livelihoods</strong>: facilitating opportunities for affected individuals to gain or regain the ability to work, earn and contribute to family and community. <strong>Research</strong>: generating evidence from the practice of mental health and development. <strong>Collaboration</strong>: managing partnerships and relationships with stakeholders who are involved in implementing the BasicNeeds MHD Model on the ground and/or are responsible for policy and practice decisions.</p>
<p>BasicNeeds has helped more than half a million people so far and through collaborating with local, national and international partners, aims to reach at least one million more people over the next five years.</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="[headshot]" height="191" src="/images/stories-of-change/2014-convenings/002_0004.jpg" width="128" /><strong>CHRIS UNDERHILL (Founder)</strong> is a global expert in the delivery of health and rehabilitation systems to very poor people. He is a serial social entrepreneur and his latest organisation, BasicNeeds, concerns the delivery of a holistic Model to mentally ill people and people with epilepsy in some of the poorest countries of the world.  Chris is a Senior Fellow with the Ashoka Fellowship and is a recipient of the Skoll Award for Social Entrepreneurship. The BasicNeeds Model for Mental Health and Development is recognised as a significant innovation in community mental health care delivery combining medical, social, economic and personal aspects into one successful programme. Over 600,000 beneficiaries having been served in the BasicNeeds global programme. Previous organisations founded by Chris include Action on Disability and Development and Thrive, and in 2000 Chris was made an MBE by her Majesty the Queen for his services to disability and development.</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="[headshot]" height="148" src="/images/stories-of-change/2014-convenings/002_0003.jpg" width="137" /><strong>NATASHA ABRAHAM</strong> joined BasicNeeds in 2012 after completing her Masters degree in International Relations at the University of Warwick, UK. Prior to studying at Warwick, she graduated in Political Science from St. Xavier&rsquo;s College, Mumbai and then worked as a teacher with The Akanksha Foundation - a non-profit focusing on educating less privileged children in India. Natasha is currently BasicNeeds&rsquo; Communications Officer and supports the organisation to increase its profile and raise awareness of global mental health generally using a variety of appropriate communications channels.</p>
<h3 class="organization"><a href="http://www.saudecrianca.org.br/en/nosso-trabalho/metodologia/" target="_blank">Sa&uacute;de Crian&ccedil;a</a></h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Organization Mission</span>: Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Sa&uacute;de Crian&ccedil;a is a social organization that works to improve and maintain the wellbeing of children who live below the poverty line by fostering the economic and social self-sustainability of their families. Sa&uacute;de Crian&ccedil;a works in numerous cities across Brazil, including Rio De Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Pernambuco, Santa Catarina, Goias and Rio Grande de Sol.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Main Organizational Goals</span>: The process begins when health professionals at partner hospitals identify children who come from families at social risk and send them to Sa&uacute;de Crian&ccedil;a. Upon joining the organization, the family works with a multidisciplinary team to create a Family Action Plan, which establishes the overarching goals to achieve self-sufficiency and the steps to reach them. The program covers five core areas:</p>
<p><strong>HEALTH:</strong> Families receive free food, medicine, medical equipment, nutritional and physiological guidance and psychiatric support. They are also given courses on hygiene, family planning, substance abuse, violence, domestic abuse and child development. <strong>INCOME:</strong> The families, in particular the mothers, are given vocational training so that they can better sustain themselves over the long term. <strong>HOUSING:</strong> Sa&uacute;de Crian&ccedil;a provides building materials and labor to families who own homes in disrepair making them vulnerable to health risks. The goal is to create healthy living conditions by ensuring that houses meet the minimum standards of shelter, which includes having running water, sewage, tiled walls and floors, and a roof, among others. <strong>CITIZENSHIP:</strong> Sa&uacute;de Crian&ccedil;a&rsquo;s legal department makes sure families are receiving every right they are entitled to. They give guidance on legal issues and on how to obtain official documents and government benefits. Our legal staff also make sure all the adults in the family have all the basic documents issued by the local authorities. <strong>EDUCATION:</strong> This program works to ensure that children of school age get an education. It requires participating families to prove that their children are enrolled in school. If they are unable to do so, Sa&uacute;de Crian&ccedil;a takes the necessary steps to get the children to school.</p>
<p>Research has shown that Saude Crian&ccedil;a&rsquo;s FAP model can reduce hospitalization rates by 60%, increase the income of assisted families by more than 35%, and lead to significant annual savings in public spending.</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="[headshot]" height="226" src="/images/stories-of-change/2014-convenings/002_0002.jpg" width="151" /><strong>Vera Cordiero,</strong> founder and CEO of the organization, is a social entrepreneur and physician. Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Sa&uacute;de Crian&ccedil;a, founded in 1991 by Dr. Vera Cordeiro is a not for-profit, nongovernmental, non-religious organization that works together with public hospitals breaking the cycle of readmissions of critically ill children from low-income, high-risk environments. ASC&rsquo;s work has been responsible for a 60% decrease in re-hospitalization days among assisted families, 38% increase in average family income and significant annual savings in public spending which helps keep more hospital beds open to those who truly need them. For its transparency, impact and wide applicability has been rewarded various prizes by institutions from around the world. Vera Cordeiro is globally recognized for her groundbreaking work in social inclusion. She is an Ashoka fellow, a Skoll Foundation and Schwab Foundation social entrepreneur, and an Avina leader. She is member of the World Council of Ashoka and from 2005 to 2011 a Board member of PATH: A Catalyst for Global Health.</p>

<h3 class="organization"><a href="http://www.noharm.org/" target="_blank">HEALTHCARE WITHOUT HARM</a></h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Organization Mission</span>: Just as the Hippocratic Oath promises to, &ldquo;first, do no harm,&rdquo; health care providers have a responsibility to eliminate practices that harm people and the environment. Healthcare Without Harm is an international coalition of 473 organizations in over 50 countries that share a vision of a health care sector that does no harm, and instead promotes the health of people and the environment. The overall mission of Health Care Without Harm is to transform the health care sector worldwide, without compromising patient safety or care, so that it is ecologically sustainable and no longer a source of harm to public health and the environment.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Main Organizational Goals</span>:&nbsp;The organization&rsquo;s 8 main goals are to <strong>create markets and policies</strong> for safer products, materials and chemicals in health care. Promote safer substitutes, including products that avoid mercury, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic and brominated flame retardants. <strong>Eliminate incineration</strong> of medical waste as well as minimize the amount of toxicity of all waste generated. <strong>Transform the design, construction and operations</strong> of health care facilities to minimize environmental impacts and foster healthy, healing environments. <strong>Encourage food purchasing systems</strong> that support sustainable food production and distribution, and provide healthy food on-site at health care facilities. <strong>Secure a safe and healthy workplace</strong> for all health care workers. <strong>Ensure patients, workers and communities have full access to information</strong> about chemicals used in health care and can participate in decisions about exposures to chemicals. <strong>Promote human rights and environmental justice</strong> for communities impacted by the health care sector, while assuring that problems are not displaced from one community or country to another. <strong>Address climate change</strong> by improving energy practices and reducing the overall climate footprint of the health care sector.</p>
<p><img align="left" height="203" src="/images/stories-of-change/2014-convenings/002_0005.jpg" width="136" /><strong>Gary Cohen</strong> has been a pioneer in the environmental health movement for thirty years. Cohen is Co-Founder and President of Health Care Without Harm and Practice Greenhealth.&nbsp; He was also instrumental in bringing together the NGOs and hospital systems that formed the Healthier Hospitals Initiative.&nbsp; All three were created to transform the health care sector to be environmentally sustainable and serve as anchor institutions to support environmental health in their communities.</p>
<p>Cohen is a member of the International Advisory Board of the Sambhavna Clinic in Bhopal, India.&nbsp; He is also on the Boards of the American Sustainable Business Council, Health Leads and Coming Clean.</p>
<p>Cohen has received the Skoll Award for Social Entrepreneurship and The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency awarded Cohen an Environmental Merit Award.&nbsp; In 2013, he was awarded the Champion of Change Award for Climate Change and Public Health by the White House.</p>

<h3 class="organization"><a href="http://visionspring.org/" target="_blank">VISIONSPRING</a></h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Organization Mission</span>: VisionSpring&rsquo;s mission is to provide affordable eyewear to people living in developing countries. Since worker productivity is often hampered by loss of vision or poor eyesight, VisionSpring aims to increase worker productivity as well as the GDP in the areas they operate in.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Main Organizational Goals</span>:&nbsp;According to research, uncorrected vision results in a loss of 202 billion dollars a year in the global economy. People who can&rsquo;t see simply can&rsquo;t work, or often at a low level of productivity. Furthermore, 90% of people with impaired vision live in developing countries. Unfortunately, glasses are not only expensive, but also simply unavailable in the parts of the world where they are needed most. In order to combat this problem, VisionSpring works to provide glasses and other vision products to low-income residents of these developing countries at an extremely reduced cost. VisionSpring trains <em>vision entrepreneurs</em> in local communities so that they can conduct vision tests and match clients with appropriate products. Individuals who need more specialized care are referred to a nearby optometrist. VisionSpring&rsquo;s model has been lambasted by some critics who pose the question &ldquo;why sell glasses when you can donate recycled pairs?&rdquo; First of all, numerous jobs are created by allowing these <em>vision entrepreneurs</em> to sell the glasses. In addition, distributing recycled glasses is far more costly and the final product is far inferior. Finally, there is no &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; in vision correction so the recycled glasses are often given out to people who don&rsquo;t need that particular kind of pair.</p>
<p>A study done in 2007 by the William Davidson institute at the University of Michigan found that VisionSpring glasses improved productivity of its recipients by roughly 35%. Furthermore research also suggested that the glasses could improve monthly income by up to 20%. Considering the $4 initial investment (cost of glasses to consumer) and a $2 average daily wage, this would result in a 108 dollar annual increase or a 2600% return on the patient&rsquo;s investment.</p>
