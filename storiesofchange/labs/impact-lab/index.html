<p><a href="http://www.barefootcollege.org" target="_blank"><strong>Barefoot College</strong></a><br /> Since its inception, the long term objective of the <a href="http://www.barefootcollege.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Barefoot College</strong></a> has been to work with marginalized, exploited and impoverished rural poor, living on less than $1 a day, and lift them over the poverty line with dignity and self respect. The dream was to establish a rural college in India that was built by and exclusively for the poor. Established in 1972, the Barefoot College is an NGO that has been providing basic services and solutions to problems in rural communities to help them become self-sufficient and sustainable. These &lsquo;Barefoot solutions&amp;#8217; can be broadly categorized into three main areas: alternative energy, water, and education, and include solar energy, health care, rural handicrafts, people&amp;#8217;s action, communication, women&amp;#8217;s empowerment and wasteland development. The College believes that for any rural development activity to be successful and sustainable, it must be based in the village as well as managed and owned by the people it serves. All Barefoot initiatives whether social, political or economic, are planned and implemented by a network of rural men and women who are known as &lsquo;Barefoot Professionals&amp;#8217;.</p>
<p>When Barefoot College founder Bunker Roy shared stories of empowered grandmothers bringing the transformative power of light to their rural communities, he created a buzz of interest among documentarians on the lookout for a good story. Jehane Noujaim and Mona Eldaief picked up cameras and headed to Africa to follow Roy as he recruits grandmothers for the program. The central story in their film focuses on the challenges faced by a Jordan woman while she is in India to attend the program. With founding support from the Sundance/Skoll Stories of Change partnership, the film will be part of the global documentary project Why Poverty?</p>
<p><strong>Meagan Carnahan Fallone</strong><br /> Senior Advisor &nbsp;to Barefoot College <br /> Meagan Carnahan Fallone is the founder of MFC Art Consulting, sourcing and supplying artwork and accessories to the luxury hotel market. Her work has won international awards for design and can be found on virtually every continent. Through her extensive travel in sourcing and developing artwork and accessories to the hotel industry, Meagan began Esprit MFC to aid and encourage women&amp;#8217;s micro-financed efforts, refugee cooperatives and social entrepreneurship in developing countries. All proceeds are used to fund educational scholarships for women and girls in Nepal, India and Africa. Meagan is also a partner in Esprit Heliski SA, an Italian based heliskiing operation.</p>
<p>Most recently, Meagan has accepted a position as Senior Advisor to Barefoot College, an award winning social enterprise, based in India. Her interest in philanthropy includes a long involvement with, Human Rights Watch, Playing for Change, and Giving Women. She speaks regularly on the modern spectrum of philanthropy and the power of its role to drive change. Her personal passions include mountaineering, kite surfing, photography, and Eastern religions. Originally from New Zealand, she was educated in the United States and United Kingdom and holds a BFA in Fine Arts and an MA in History of Art. She lives in Switzerland with her three children Nicholas, Ian and Julian.</p>

Her mother worked as a designer in the handicraft department and her father worked as an artist and Barefoot Photographer until he passed away in 2004.

Alongside Bunker Roy and following the theory of learning by doing, Bata mastered photography, film editing, and computer skills on the job. Today, she edits films independently and has completed over 20 films for Barefoot College on subjects that include solar engineering, rain water harvesting, solar-powered desalination, the right to work, Night School and other stories about Barefoot College. She has traveled to Bhutan, Gambia, Mauritania and Mali-Timbuktu to make films about women Barefoot Solar Engineers.</p>
<p><strong>Mona Eldaief </strong><br /> Director, Producer &amp; Filmmaker <br /> Born in Cairo, Egypt and raised in the United States, filmmaker Mona Edaief graduated from New York University with a degree in political science and photography. Her documentary feature credits include <em>Control Room</em>, <em>A Wedding In Ramallah</em>, and <em>Her Name Is Zelda</em>. Aspiring to use video advocacy as a tool for social change, Mona began her career as the producer of<em> MTV News Unfiltered</em>.</p>

Mona is currently directing and shooting <em>Barefoot Engineers</em>. The documentary feature focuses on a Jordanian Bedouin woman&amp;#8217;s struggle to learn solar engineering in order to bring work to women in her village and help alleviate poverty, against the patriarchal rules of her society.</p>

The three main goals that drive mothers2mothers&amp;#8217; work and are critical to achieving their mission are: preventing babies from contracting HIV through mother-to-child transmission, keeping mothers with HIV and their babies healthy, and empowering mothers living with HIV. The organization operates in 7 countries and currently serves over 275,000 HIV positive pregnant women and new mothers throughout the world.</p>
<p>The UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were adopted by world leaders in 2000 to provide concrete, numerical benchmarks for tackling extreme poverty in its many dimensions. mothers2mothers advances four of the eight MDGs that most directly affect Women&amp;#8217;s and Children&amp;#8217;s Health, including: Promoting Gender Equality and Empowering Women, Reducing Child Mortality, Improving Maternal Health, and Combating HIV/AIDS.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pih.org" target="_blank"><strong>Partners In Health</strong></a><br /> <a href="http://www.pih.org/" target="_blank">Partners In Health</a> (PIH) is a Boston, Massachusetts based non-profit health care organization dedicated to providing a &lsquo;preferential option for the poor&amp;#8217;. It was founded in 1987 by Dr. Paul Farmer, Ophelia Dahl, Thomas J. White, Todd McCormack, and Dr. Jim Yong Kim. Since then, PIH has grown to 11,000 employees working in 49 health centers and hospitals across 11 countries, from the US to Siberia and Malawi. PIH strives to provide an alternative to the conventional curative method of treatment for the sick and instead tries to prevent diseases before they occur. This model believes that primary health care is essential because health is a right and therefore, it should be available to everyone. PIH strives to bring good medical care to the poor by establishing long-term partnerships with local sister organizations.<br /> PIH believes in 5 fundamental principles:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Providing universal access to    primary health care</li>
<li>Making health care and education    free to the poor</li>
<li>Hiring and training community    health workers</li>
<li>Fighting disease means fighting    poverty</li>
<li>Partnering with local and    national governments</li>
</ul>
<p>Tracey Kidder&amp;#8217;s Pulitzer Prize-winning best-seller <a href="http://www.tracykidder.com/books/mountains/" target="_blank"><em>Mountains Beyond Mountains</em></a>, made a kind of global health rock star out of quietly charismatic Dr. Paul Farmer. Treating drug-resistant TB in Haiti, he and his partners openly defied the global public health care system insisting on curing a disease that conventional wisdom said was incurable. Stories of Change filmmakers Kief Davidson and Cori Stern&amp;#8217;s documentary will portray a diverse group of everyday health care heroes working on an expansive model of global health delivery.</p>

In YouthBuild programs, low-income young people ages 16 to 24 work full-time for 6 to 24 months toward their GEDs or high school diplomas while learning job skills by building affordable housing in their communities. Emphasis is placed on leadership development, community service, and the creation of a positive mini-community of adults and youth committed to each others&amp;#8217; success. The mission of YouthBuild USA is to unleash the intelligence and positive energy of low-income youth to rebuild their communities and their lives.</p>
<p>The Stories of Change partnership connected Stoneman and filmmaker Annie Sundberg to explore ways to tell their story. The 2010 short film&nbsp;<em>Youth Build</em> was supported by The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and plans are in the works for a new Sundance-funded series of twelve short films that trace the transformative moments in YouthBuild&amp;#8217;s history.</p>
